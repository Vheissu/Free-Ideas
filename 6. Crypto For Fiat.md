### #6 Crypto <For> Fiat

What was once thought of as a trend is now a real and popular thing. I am of course talking about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and the many others being actively bought and trade.

## The Problem

Unless you have a mining rig, are part of a crypto trading platform or already have coins to trade, getting into cryptocurrencies can be hard. Coupled with the fact people on eBay and forums are out to overcharge and rip people off, there's a serious space in the market to capitalise on.

Basically it's hard to buy cryptocoins unless of course you're only buying Bitcoin.

## The Solution

The proposed Crypto For Fiat platform would allow people to sell their crypto coins for fiat and or buy crypto with fiat. It would be a two way exchange allowing for both sellers and purchasers.

## Caveats

Security is a big concern in the cryptocurrency space. It feels like every week you're hearing of a seemingly large Bitcoin or cryptocoin exchange being hacked and all coins lost. This would need to be a consideration when building such a platform.

* Where would the coins be held, would it be user to user with escrow for payment?

* How would the site prevent users being ripped off?

* How would fiat be accepted considering Paypal don't offer protection for virtual goods? The site would need to consider this.
