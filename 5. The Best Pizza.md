## #5 The Best Pizza

### The Problem

Finding the best pizza can be a difficult task. It all depends on the country, region and establishment that you choose to buy your pizza from. Urbanspoon and other sites that allow people to rate restaurants and places to eat do half the work, but they don't take into account people give glowing reviews of their favourite places to eat other places you might not be looking.

* Twitter
* Facebook
* Blogs
* Forums
* Review sites
* The list goes on...

### The Solution

It's Foursquare meets Urbanspoon in an app.

These are all potential avenues you can persue information on the best pizza places around. This would presumably be a mobile app in the same vain as Foursquare in that it would be location aware.

The best pizza places would be ranked by the following but not limited too factors:

* Sentiment analysis - Are people saying great things about a particular pizza place? Particular words that would positively describe a great place like: tasty, friendly, fresh, authentic, amazing, delicious, etc.

* Review rating score - There are quite a few places out there that allow the community to review something, Urbanspoon comes to mind here. What rating has it received there and other places of importance?

* Number of people talking about an establishment - Is there a lot of fresh buzz around a place, maybe it's new or newly discovered. Coupled with sentiment analysis you could get a good idea as to what people think.
