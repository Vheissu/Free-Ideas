### Salads on Demand

The world collectively is becoming increasingly obese. People aren't exercising as much as they should, game consoles making us lazy and of course, junk food is cheap to buy.

Taking the whole online food ordering approach to the next level, imagine a service that allows you to construct salads online and have them delivered to your door? Lunches, catering, workplace supplied food.

The salads would be fresh and most of all affordable as well as conforming to standard recommended meal size and dietary intake.

There are of course hurdles to overcome such as getting the cost down low enough to make it affordable for everyday people and obtaining fresh ingredients daily to make the salads with minimal waste.

Just food for thought.
