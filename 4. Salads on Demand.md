## #4 Salads on Demand

### The Problem

The world collectively is becoming increasingly obese. People aren't exercising as much as they should, game consoles making us lazy and of course, junk food is cheap to buy. Not only that, but those who want to eat healthy, sometimes can't because they lead busy lives.

### The Solution

Taking the whole online food ordering approach to the next level, imagine a service that allows you to construct salads online and have them delivered to your door? Lunches, catering, workplace supplied food.

The salads would be fresh and most of all affordable, as well as conforming to standard recommended meal size and dietary intake. The salads would be prepared by local kitchens to save on costs and money split with the local kitchen itself.

There are of course hurdles to overcome such as getting the cost down low enough to make it affordable for everyday people and obtaining fresh ingredients daily to make the salads with minimal waste.

### Caveats

* Fresh food is more expensive
* Food requires storage
* Significant capital required to get such an idea off the ground
* Do people want fresh salads opposed to unhealthy and cheaper options?
* Preparation and delivery costs, mechanisms

Just food for thought.
