## #12 Uber For Roadside Assitance

### The problem

Roadside assistance is generally reserved for those a part of a membership club. In Australia it is RACQ, you pay a yearly fee and get roadside assistance when you're broken down. If you're not a member, you can get assistance but have to pay (especially if you need to be towed).

### The solution

Much like Uber revolutionised the taxi industry, this app could revolutionise roadside assistance and towing. You won't need to pay a yearly fee, see roadside assistance vehicles near you and get a flat rate call-out and fix estimate price.

### Existing solutions

Uber is an obvious existing solution, there are a few other little clones around, but if done correctly, this could be a market leader in a relatively untouched niche.
