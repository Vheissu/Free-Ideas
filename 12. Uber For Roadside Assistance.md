## #12 Uber For Roadside Assitance

### The problem

Roadside assistance is generally reserved for those a part of a membership club. In Australia it is RACQ, you pay a yearly fee and get roadside assistance when you're broken down. If you're not a member, you can get assistance but have to pay (especially if you need to be towed).

### The solution

Much like Uber revolutionised the taxi industry, this app could revolutionise roadside assistance and towing. You won't need to pay a yearly fee, see roadside assistance vehicles near you and get a flat rate call-out and fix estimate price.

Mechanics could install the app to make some additional money on the side. During quiet periods you could send out a mechanic to help someone broken down, marketing this towards mechanic shops to make some extra cash could also work, but pigeonholing it to a tight segment of the market could limit its spread.

### Existing solutions

Uber is an obvious existing solution as well as preexisting roadside assistance services, there are a few other little clones around, but if done correctly, this could be a market leader in a relatively untouched niche.
